This is the README file for Structures and Typedef and will contain files for the first ever introduction and exploration of the topic of structs and typedef when and how to use them.

Structs - Structs are best used when you need to represent simple data types, such as integers, strings, or other basic data types. They are also useful when you need to work with large datasets, such as arrays or lists, where performance is critical.

Typedef - The primary use of typedef is to make code more readable and maintainable. By creating an alias for a complex data type, programmers can avoid writing out the full name of the data type every time it is used in the code, making the code easier to read and write.
