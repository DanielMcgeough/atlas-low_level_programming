This is the readme for the bit manipulation project for Atlas School of the Januray 2024 cohort. This is a very confusing topic and there are no good resources which is an issue I lay squarely at the feet of Atlas School. They did not give us any guidance or show how bit manipulation works in any way. Recently in the project I had to complete the quiz by guessing and using calculators. Atlas failed its students as far as bit manipulation is concerned.
