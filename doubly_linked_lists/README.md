This is the Readme file for the Doubly Linked Lists project for the January 2024 Cohort at Atlas School. In this project after having utilized, created and modified singly linked lists, we are moving onto doubly linked lists.
Doubly Linked lists have the advantage of being able to navigate forward and backward and are used in cases were reverting might be advantageous, such as redoing or undoing in an editor of any kind.
