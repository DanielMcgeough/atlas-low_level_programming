Search Algorithms
This is the README for the Search Algorithms project for the Jan 2024 Cohort at Atlas.
The point of this project is to build off of the earlier experiences of sorting
algorithms. First we created large data sets and then we explored ways to sort them.
Moving forward we are going to now search through those algorithms for specific
values and then print those. It is the penultimate project of T1 so it is a whine
down of sorts to use the Cuban slang term which I like.
