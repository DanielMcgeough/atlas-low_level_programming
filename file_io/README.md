This is the README file for the file I/O project for the January 2024 cohortat Atlas School. The aim of this project is too familiarize students with the File Descriptors and the Open, Read and Write functions in C. It also will include a few other commands. As someone who already studied write functions I assume I will be aided by this. Yet as always, sometimes the answer teaches more than the questions do.
